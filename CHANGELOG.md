#### Changed

- Fixed the lack of foreign key references on the `controlled_airspace_segments` and `restrictive_airspace_segments` tables.
- Added detail to the `controlled_airspace_segments` and `restrictive_airspace_segments` to make querying the segment altitudes easier.

### [0.9.3] - 2024-11-25

#### Added

- Support for sqlite.

#### Changed

- All procedure parts are on the same level. This was done to handle certain procedures that are only transitions, without a core segment. In addition, it keeps all of the subsections on the same level of nesting. Access the `core` segment in the same way as you would a `runway_transition`.
- The generic `transition` has been renamed `enroute_transition` to distinguish it from other types.

#### Removed

- "Top level" `core` section of procedures. This has been relocated as a segment of type `core`, accessed in the same way as `runway_transition` and `enroute_transition`.

### [0.9.2] - 2024-07-13
